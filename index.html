					<h2>About Us</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p>You have reached this far, which means you have taken an interest in finding out more about us. To be honest this is not the place where you will do that although it is a start.</p>
					<p>The Club in its present format was resurrected in 2002 by three ex-serviceman. The idea being is to ride and mix with likeminded people who enjoy the craic. We are not a charitable organisation, although we do on occasion raise money for certain military charities, we are all about brotherhood and sisterhood as we do not discriminate in who rides with us.</p>
					<p>We are made up from men &amp; women who have served in Her Majesty’s Armed Forces and Reserve. Due to the political situation in the biking community and wishing to survive as a bike club within the United Kingdom we do not actively recruit members who are currently serving in or have served in the Police force, Prison service or Customs service. This is not a slight on you or your profession of choice it is just a matter of survival in the biking world.</p>
					<p>We ride, rally and party together wearing our club patch with pride and honour. To enquire about membership you should email the Secretary (<a href="mailto:secretary@aavmcc.co.uk">secretary@aavmcc.co.uk</a>) who will arrange a meeting. We need to decide that you're the right person, with the right attitude to ride, party and join us. The joining process may take more than a year (however we don't use the prospect way of recruiting) during which we'll get to know you before offering you full membership.</p>
					<p>To become a member you  must be serving or have served in HM Armed Forces full time or reservist; man or woman. You must own a full motorcycle licence and own and ride a motorcycle of 500cc or more. Your conduct on discharge should be good or above; proof of service will be required.</p>
					<p>Come and say hello to any of us we don’t bite, we attend numerous rallies each year throughout the UK and Europe. Last of all, thanks for taking time out to visit our website.</p>
